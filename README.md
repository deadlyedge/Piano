# Piano
pygame learning

This weekend I work with my kid for a sciense-music project and
here are some code for it.

I choose pygame because I want to learn to use class object in my
other learning project, I think this project is good for me to
try thinking objects.

I am a rookie in coding, codes looks stupid and because I tried 
to grab codes from lot's of other masters, the code style maybe
confused, and I'm sorry for that.

## I learned from this project:
```
  start an pygame project
  KEY event listening
  show text in pygame
  move an object
  remove an object
  use Tk for loading file
  replace Tk with pygame-pgu because Mac won't let me to open 
  another window
```  

##  and
  I actually start this program with winsound module, and it did
  works.  Through winsound I showed my kid the connection in
  frequency and sound with the Beep function, so I keep that name
  used continued.
  
This program is written in python 3.7 with pygame 1.9.6, although 
it could work with python 3.8 but you have to choose install the 
beta version of pygame (2.0) or it will not installed successfully.

I am study coding from home by myself, so if anyone think any idea
which could make my code looks better, you're my teacher!

## One more thing:
If you want to run this program you will need the Piano sound .WAV
files, which should be found at https://github.com/saransha/EasyElectric

you have to download them and put to './Piano' director first.

for soundMac.V0.2.py, add fuction: save and load.

#### Remember, 
 * '\(backslash)' to record and stop, 

 * 'backspace' to playback.
 
Now, you can use
 
 * ']' to save record to a file, and use
 
 * '[' to load them back.

#### This program should works both on Mac and PC.
